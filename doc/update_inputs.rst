How to update inputs from DocDB
===============================

Context: Inputs from DocDB that require reformatting before using are kept
in data/inputs/ and then reformatted using scripts in bin/ .  Inputs from
DocDB that can be used as-is are directly added to their final location
under data/.

Basic Setup
===========

Make branches of both desimodel GitHub code and svn data::

    git checkout -b update_inputs
    base=https://desi.lbl.gov/svn/code/desimodel
    svn copy $base/trunk $base/branches/update_inputs
    svn checkout $base/branches/update_inputs/data
    export DESIMODEL=`pwd`

Add entries to $HOME/.netrc to enable downloading DocDB files without
having to enter a password every time::

    machine desi.lbl.gov
    login StephenBailey
    password NotMyRealPassword

The code in :mod:`desimodel.inputs.docdb` requires `requests`_
(for communicating with DocDB) and `xlrd`_ (for reading Microsoft Excel spreadsheets).
Both of these are available via Anaconda.

.. _`requests`: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
.. _`xlrd`: http://www.python-excel.org/

Inputs to update
================

The update functions below belong to :mod:`desimodel.inputs` and take an optional
argument ``testdir`` to specify an alternate directory where updated outputs should be written.
When ``testdir`` is not specified, outputs are written to their standard locations
under :func:`desimodel.io.datadir`.

DESI-0530-v13 Excel spreadsheet to .ecsv file for GFA locations
---------------------------------------------------------------

This writes the ``gfa.ecsv`` file containing the GFA data, which
is pulled from the "GFALocation" tab on the DESI-0530-v13 Excel spreadsheet
and from rows 16-23 and columns A-I. The function
:func:`desimodel.inputs.gfa.build_gfa_table` writes the file in the current directory.

::

    import desimodel.inputs.gfa
    desimodel.inputs.gfa.build_gfa_table()

Positioner to Fiber Mapping
---------------------------

This updates the mapping of device locations on the focal plane to
spectrograph fiber numbers using DESI-0530-v14, DESI-2721-v2 and DESI-329-v15.

::

    import desimodel.inputs.fiberpos
    desimodel.inputs.fiberpos.update()

To update a DESI-doc versions, edit the corresponding ``docdb.download(...)`` call.

Throughput
----------

This updates the throughput model from DESI-0347 and DESI-0344 and also copies the
top-level ``desi.yaml`` from DESI-0347:

::

    import desimodel.inputs.throughput
    desimodel.inputs.throughput.update()

To update the version of DESI-347 that is used, change the default value of
``desi347_version`` in the ``update()`` function.  Similiarly for DESI-344.

Only three rows of the throughput spreadsheet from DESI-347 are used, with
hard-coded row numbers.  There are some simple checks that these are correct,
using the ``specthru_row`` and ``thru_row`` arguments to ``load_throughput()``,
but check the outputs carefully if you think the spreadsheet structure might
have changed.

Blur and Offsets
----------------

Use the notebook ``doc/nb/DESI-0347_Throughput.ipynb`` to update the following
ouputs derivied from DESI-347:

  * data/inputs/throughput/raytracing.txt
  * data/throughput/DESI-0347_blur.ecsv
  * data/throughput/DESI-0347_offset.ecsv
  * data/throughput/DESI-0347_static_offset_[123].fits

Refer to the instructions in that notebook for details.

Testing
-------

After changing any outputs that might break a unit test, update the small test
dataset following :doc:`testing` and edit ``DESIMODEL_VERSION`` in ``.travis.yml``
to point to the new version.

Commissioning Instrument corners
--------------------------------

This updates the CI as-measured corner locations from DESI-4633v11 Corners.txt
and reformats them into the GFA-corners format needed by desimodel, writing
the results into ``$$DESIMODEL/data/focalplane/ci-corners.ecsv``:

::

    import desimodel.inputs.ci
    desimodel.inputs.ci.update()

We don't anticipate needing to update this again, so this section is just
documenting the provenance of that file.

To Do
=====

Update methodology and document how to update the following:

  * PSF model from DESI-0334
  * PSF spots -> PSF for quicksim
  * Fiber input loss calculations
  * desimodel/data/focalplane/platescale.txt
